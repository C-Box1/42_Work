# ft_printf

## Description

`ft_printf` is a custom implementation of the standard C library function `printf`.
The goal of this project is to reproduce the behavior of `printf` for a subset of format specifiers, while gaining a deeper understanding of variadic functions, parsing, and formatted output in C.

This library provides the function:

```c
int ft_printf(const char *format, ...);
```
